const message = `My Jaan❤️,

I know we talk about a thousand things every single day, yet somehow the most important ones stay quietly inside my heart… waiting for a moment like this, waiting to be written in a special way.

I don’t know much about writing. But I know this — I have endless things to write about you.

I still remember the first time I saw you.
That shy-looking girl… wearing that soft shade of green, like a peacock carrying its quiet elegance. You looked so pretty, so unaware of the storm you were about to create in my heart.

And then I discovered your talkative side. And no, it’s not just your voice that’s beautiful — it’s the energy behind it, the emotions inside it, the way you say the simplest things as if they carry a secret meaning. Maybe for someone else, it’s normal. But for me, it feels special. Very special.

From the moment we started talking, it didn’t feel new. It felt like two old friends meeting after years, continuing a conversation that was paused somewhere in another lifetime. Sometimes it still feels unreal.

But then again… everything about you feels unreal.

So clumsy at times.
So shy on the outside.
Yet with the most mischievous, devilish thoughts hiding behind that innocent face.

And when you entered my home… it wasn’t just a person walking in.

You changed the temperature.
You changed the fragrance.
You changed the entire atmosphere.

You don’t just walk into a room — you transform it.
You don’t just smile — you rearrange my entire day.

There is something about you that feels like home… like a place my heart had been searching for long before I even knew your name.

I love the way you laugh without holding back.
I love the way your eyes soften when you truly listen.
I love how your presence turns ordinary moments into memories I never want to forget.

When I imagine the future, it doesn’t come with loud celebrations or grand dreams. It comes with simple things — rainy drives, late-night talks, comfortable silences, and your hand resting in mine.

If life is a long road, I don’t want shortcuts.
I just want to walk it beside you.

You are not just someone I love.
You are someone I choose — every single day.

And if I had to live this life again… in every lifetime, in every universe, in every version of destiny — I would still search for you. I would still choose you.


“Shayad likha tha taqdeer mein tera naam kahin,
Tabhi har mod par tera hi khayal aaya.”

Always yours,
Parth ❤️`;
